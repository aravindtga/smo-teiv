# Topology & Inventory Overview

Topology & Inventory manages the representation of topology and
inventory resources in a suite of evolving vendor-agnostic data models
to share and operate on a common view of the topology.

# Introducing topology and inventory data

Topology and inventory data is the information that represents entities
in a telecommunications network and the relationships between them that
provide insight into a particular aspect of the network of importance to
specific use cases. Topology and inventory data can be derived from
inventory, configuration, or other data. Topology & Inventory is being
updated autonomously based on changes in the network.

Topology & Inventory supports several topology and inventory domains,
The understanding of the model is important to enable a user making
queries on topology and inventory data. The entities are modeled as
managed objects (found under the schema in the data dictionary) and
grouped together in modules based on functionality.
